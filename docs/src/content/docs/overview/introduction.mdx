This project aims to provide a high-level framework for developing Rust-based dapps on Cartesi machines. The framework will offer a set of tools and libraries to facilitate the development of dapps within the Rust environment, leveraging the [Rollups API](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/api/). This includes tools for creation, testing, and deployment of decentralized applications, enabling developers to interact with the Cartesi machine from Rust.

## Features

-   **Rollup API Integration**: Full support for interacting with the [Rollups API](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/api/) from Rust.
-   **High-level Abstractions**: Simplified interfaces for common tasks such as state management, event handling, and more.
-   **Examples**: Comprehensive examples demonstrating how to build dapps using CrabRolls.
-   **Testing Suite**: Integrated tools for robust testing without requiring running a Cartesi machine, leveraging Rust's testing capabilities.
-   **Cargo Integration**: Easy distribution and installation through Rustâ€™s build system and package manager with [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), deploying the framework as a crate on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
-   **Comprehensive Documentation**: Utilizing the tool [starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) for documentation, including examples, guides, and API references.
